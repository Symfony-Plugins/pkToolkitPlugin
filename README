=pkToolkitPlugin=

pkToolkitPlugin is a collection of useful classes implementing common
routines and algorithms we otherwise find ourselves reinventing in
nearly every application. The golden rules for inclusion in pkToolkitPlugin
are simple: it should be something that PHP should have had in the first place,
and the implementation shouldn't be huge or have major dependencies on
other libraries not typically built into PHP 5.2.x.

pkToolkitPlugin classes generally contain straightforward static public
methods. They are grouped in classes in order to gain the benefits of 
autoloading and keep the PHP namespace uncluttered.

For the time being, see the comments in the code for documentation.
